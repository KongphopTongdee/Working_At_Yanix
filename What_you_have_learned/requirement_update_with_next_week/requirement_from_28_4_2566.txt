bayesian output
requirement 
1. select example shape region ขอบ with 3 picture predicted the 4 picture
2. get in the bayesian model by calculate from equation
3. output if we select the apple then we will show apple (we will get metrix)
concept of research : need to build the tools that easy for the user and developer
proof of concept : need to solve only for equation don’t need to do more architecture

singular value from the oval is expand from metrix 
oval is in the jacobian 
similar to covariance matrix

concept PCA is to rotate of oval to independent

from onboarding you need to focus on bayesian and picture scale

on working of yannix = you need to develop your own program it easy to understand and use it.

harnonical test = test with ออบเบืยด (ideal test) after that you need to climb up to hard test. 

how to solve this problem : change this to float channels from [0,255] 

optional - you can design what to test and what to build (you need to design the ui by constrast with mathlab)
first design : create class
